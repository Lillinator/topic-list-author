# Discourse Topic List Author

This is a theme component that makes the topic author appear in topic filter list pages (ie: /latest /new /unread /top, category pages) and the category homepage. It also allows changing the placement of the author column in topic filter list pages and the category homepage. Works in both desktop and mobile views. Some column settings may not be compatible with right-to-left language interfaces. https://meta.discourse.org/t/topic-list-author/269910
